# Dynamic Form Generator Application using React.js

## Overview

Create a dynamic form generator application using React.js that enables users to build custom forms with various form fields. The application should support adding and removing fields, specifying field types, and saving/loading form configurations as JSON data.

## Key Features

1. **Dynamic Form Building:**
   - Users can add and remove form fields dynamically.
   - Each form field includes a label and a corresponding component based on the selected field type.

2. **Field Types:**
   - Supported field types: text input, text area, dropdown, checkbox, radio button.

3. **Dropdown Options:**
   - Users can define options for dropdown fields.

4. **Form Submission and Validation:**
   - The application supports form submission and provides validation.
   - Error messages are displayed for invalid fields.

5. **Save and Load Configurations:**
   - Users can save and load form configurations as JSON data.

## Additional Challenges (Optional)

1. **Validation Rules:**
   - Users can set validation rules, including required fields, minimum/maximum length, and specific formats (e.g., email, phone number).

2. **Conditional Logic:**
   - Implement conditional logic for form fields, where the visibility of certain fields depends on the value of other fields.

3. **File Upload Support:**
   - Add support for file upload fields with validation for file type and size.
